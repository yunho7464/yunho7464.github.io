## About
Hello! My name is Yun. I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by [Professor Pedro Lopes](http://lab.plopes.org).

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction. I play with body movements and perceptions, and I am curious about how people feel when a device **moves you**.
