## About
Hello! My name is Yun. I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chicago, advised by [Professor Pedro Lopes](http://lab.plopes.org).

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction. I play with body movements and perceptions, and I am curious about how people feel when a device **moves you**.

### SplitBody: Reducing Mental Workload while Multitasking via Muscle Stimulation

Techniques like electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) offer promise in assisting physical tasks by automating movements. However, existing actuation systems improve the performance of a task that users are **already focusing on**. Instead, we investigate whether these interactive-actuation systems (e.g., EMS) offer any benefits if they automate a task that happens in the **background** of the user's focus. In our study, participants performed a cognitively-demanding **multitask aided by EMS (SplitBody condition)** or performed by themselves (baseline). We found that with SplitBody performance increased (35% on both tasks, 18% on the non-EMS-automated task), physical-demand decreased (31%), and mental-workload decreased (26%).
